# Microsoft Internship Project
	
Industry name: Health
Project title: Onehealthy
# Technologies used: Azure static web app, Azure QnA Maker & Azure Bot Service
Other services: HTML, CSS & JavaScript
# Problem statement: 

•	In today’s fast paced world people are not able to evaluate if they are getting overweight or underweight due to work from home pressure. They are also not taking proper intake of water.
•	Hence, to solve this problem I have made a static web app where we can check our BMI(Body Mass Index) & Hydration requirement(water required per day).
•	I have also implemented DARK MODE to prevent eye strain in this work from home.


# Project Description: 

•	I have created an azure static web app in which core idea is that it can relieve ourselves from the ambiguity that we are healthy or not.
•	Hence, by my website we can check the BMI level and hydration requirement per day according to our weight and height.
•	My website has the HOME page, BMI calculator page, Hydration Calculator page and a dark mode toggle switch.
•	There is also an Azure Bot Service for any Queries.
•	I have used JavaScript for the calculation of BMI(Body Mass Index) and the Current hydration requirement per day.

•	I have also implemented DARK MODE to prevent eye strain during work from home.
•	For any query we can ask Azure Bot.
